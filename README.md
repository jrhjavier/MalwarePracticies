# MalwarePracticies
This project, part of the 3rd year coursework for the degree in Cybersecurity Engineering, focuses on malware analysis and exploration. The project covers various aspects of malware, including assembly language, shellcode, Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), droppers, YARA rules, and three Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges involving static and dynamic analysis.
